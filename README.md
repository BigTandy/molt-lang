# Molt: a Math Oriented Language Tool

## Summary

In this project, we will design a simple procedural programming language and implement a parser & interpreter for it. The language will be focused on the realm of mathematics, with specific language features for solving equations, graphing, and evaluation. We will feature numbers and sets as first-class types. Importing of other files is not in the scope of the project at this time.

The syntax of our language will be inspired by Python as a starting point, with some modifications to make parsing easier (e.g. the usage of curly brackets rather than significant whitespace). An attempt will be made to prioritize pure functions, with the majority of side effects being handled in top-level statements, rather than functions. Conditional logic will be handled by piecewise expressions, while looping may be accomplished by recursion; in this way, Turing-completeness is reached.
